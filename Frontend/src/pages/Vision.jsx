          <p className="text-blue-800 mb-8 font-serif">
            Our platform offers a range of resources and tools to help beginners
            get started, and to support more experienced coders in their ongoing

            We believe that coding is not just a skill, but a way of thinking
            and problem-solving that can help people succeed in any field. Our
            goal is to make coding accessible and enjoyable for everyone, and to
            create a community where coders can connect, collaborate, and learn
            from each other.
